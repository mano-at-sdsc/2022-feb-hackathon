This hackathon has both synchronous and asynchronous work, with concentrated hackathon sessions on specific data sets. Participants can attend whichever hackathon sessions they are interested in. Participants can also form working groups and tackle issues throughout the week organized in a GitHub repository. There is no minimum work requirement, all are welcome to participate as much or as little as schedules and interest allow! Hackathon Benefits: Gain experience with Common Fund data sets and have access to data set curators! See an immediate product from a short burst of concentrated effort! Meet researchers with common interests and potentially spur collaborations or funding efforts! Participating CF Partners and their Resources: Common Fund Data Ecosystem Search Portal - A portal that provides access to CFDE data across all programs. Extracellular RNA Communication - A repository of small RNA sequences and qPCR-derived exRNA profiles from human and mouse biofluids with over 7,500 entries. Metabolomics Workbench - A collection of structures and annotations of over biologically relevant metabolites with over 164,000 entries. Signature Commons LINCS - A web-based search engine representing over 1.5 million gene expression signatures processed, visualized, and analyzed from LINCS, GTEx, and GEO databases. Tentative Schedule: Data Time Topic Links Monday 2/21 9 am - 11:30 am PT Introduction to data sets Tuesday 2/22 9 am - 11:30 am PT exRNA data hackathon session Wednesday 2/23 9 am - 11:30 am PT Metabolomics Workbench hackathon session Thursday 2/24 11:30 pm - 2 pm PT SigCom LINCS hackathon session Friday 2/25 9 am - 11:30 am PT Wrap up & future directions Participant Skill Level: The hackathon is open to the public, and anyone can attend. Despite the name \u201chackathon\u201d, participants don\u2019t need to be experts in computer science! The most important criteria is interest in the data sets, and some familiarity with the command line and GitHub is helpful but not required.
