This hackathon has both synchronous and asynchronous work, with concentrated hackathon sessions on specific data sets. Participants can attend whichever hackathon sessions they are interested in. Participants can also form working groups and tackle issues throughout the week organized in a GitHub repository. There is no minimum work requirement, all are welcome to participate as much or as little as schedules and interest allow! Hackathon Benefits Gain experience with Common Fund data sets and have access to data set curators! See an immediate product from a short burst of concentrated effort! Meet researchers with common interests and potentially spur collaborations or funding efforts! Participant Skill Level The hackathon is open to the public, and anyone can attend. Despite the name \u201chackathon\u201d, participants don\u2019t need to be experts in computer science! The most important criteria is interest in the data sets, and some familiarity with the command line and GitHub is helpful but not required.
