#### [Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Search Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/)

The [CFDE search portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/) provides metadata
search functionality across
[NIH Common Fund data](https://commonfund.nih.gov/) for many
programs. Guided hackathon activities for this round will focus on
accessing, exporting, and working with Human Microbiome Project data
sets, but we encourage participants to explore all of the data available
through the portal!
