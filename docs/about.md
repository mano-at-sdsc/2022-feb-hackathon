#### [Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Search Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/)

The [CFDE search portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/) provides metadata
search functionality across
[NIH Common Fund data](https://commonfund.nih.gov/) for many
programs. Guided hackathon activities for this round will focus on
accessing, exporting, and working with Human Microbiome Project data
sets, but we encourage participants to explore all of the data available
through the portal!

#### [Extracellular RNA Communication (exRNA)](https://exrna-atlas.org/)

[exRNA](https://exrna-atlas.org/) is small RNA sequences and qPCR-derived exRNA profiles from human and mouse biofluids with over 7,500 entries. The exRNA session will describe two use cases:

1) Exploring RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) and their associated RNA cargo in a various human biofluids and their potential utility as biomarkers, using data from the exRNA Atlas [https://exrna-atlas.org/](https://exrna-atlas.org/).

2) Interrogating other sites across the genome by intersecting exRNA Atlas data with regions of interest using BedGraph files (“data slicing”), and the broader application of this approach to non-RBP sites and other data sets. 

#### [Metabolomics Workbench](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/)

[Metabolomics Workbench](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/) is a collection of structures and annotations of over biologically relevant metabolites with over 164,000 entries.

#### [Signature Commons Library of Integrated Network-Based Cell Signatures (LINCS)](https://maayanlab.cloud/sigcom-lincs/#/SignatureSearch/UpDown)

[SigCom LINCS](https://maayanlab.cloud/sigcom-lincs/#/SignatureSearch/UpDown) is web-based search engine representing over 1.5 million gene expression signatures processed, visualized, and analyzed from LINCS, GTEx, and GEO databases.
