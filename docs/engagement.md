# More About Engaging with the Common Fund Data Ecosystem

In addition to accessing and working with Common Fund data sets, there are a variety of opportunities for continued engagement with the Common Fund Data Ecosystem.

[Common Fund Data Ecosystem Engagement Opportunity Award Plans](https://www.nih-cfde.org/engagement_page/engagement-opportunities-for-common-fund-programs/)

The NIH offers an R03 funding opportunity to demonstrate and enhance the utility of widely available and useful Common Fund data sets. This work can 
involve generating hypotheses and catalyzing discoveries with these data sets, while also providing feedback on the utility of Common Fund data resources.
More information about funding opportunities is on [R03 Opportunity for Pilot Projects Enhancing Utility and Usage of Common Fund Data Sets](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-19-012.html).

[Common Fund Working Groups](https://www.nih-cfde.org/engagement_page/events-and-helpdesks/)

In the effort to encourage FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and resuable) principles for data across NIH Common Fund programs, 
the CFDE hosts monthly cross-pollination webinar events and is starting up working groups. Please see the [CFDE Working Group Page](https://www.nih-cfde.org/engagement_page/events-and-helpdesks/)
for more information.

[Common Fund Training Resources](https://www.nih-cfde.org/engagement_page/training-resources/)

The [CFDE's training website](https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/) hosts tutorials and resources about accessing NIH Common Fund program 
metadata/data and performing common bioinformatic analyses.
